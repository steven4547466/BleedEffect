BleedEffect is a plugin for SCP: Secret Lab. It adds a... bleed effect... to players when they take damage from configurable damage types.

You can always find the latest dll [here](https://github.com/steven4547466/BleedEffect/releases/latest). This plugin requires EXILED, which you can find [here](https://github.com/galaxy119/EXILED).

Please report any issues, or feature requests!

## Config options

- Debug (false) - Whether or not to enable debug messages.
- BleedMessage ("You feel warm blood from your wounds.") - The message shown to players when they start bleeding.
- IncreasedBleedMessage ("You feel your wounds deepen.") - The message shown to players when they begin taking increased damage due to excessive bleeding.
- ShotsToBleed (4) - The number of shots it takes to start bleeding.
- HealthDrainPerSecond (0.1) - The health drained per second.
- HealthDrainExponential (true) - Whether or not health drain is exponential for successive bleeding.
- HealthDrainDivisor (-15) - If HealthDrainPerSecond is less than 1 and HealthDrainExponential is true, this will be the number that # of BleedEffects is divided by before raising HealthDrainPerSecond by it (HealthDrainPerSecond^(# of BleedEffects/HealthDrainDivisor) This should always be < 0. The lower this number is, the less health is drained when taking successive bleed effects.).
